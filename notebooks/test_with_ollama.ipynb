      "üß† Answer: According to the provided context, AI has evolved significantly since its inception in the 1950s. Initially inspired by the human brain's capabilities, early researchers sought to create machines that could perform tasks such as playing chess or solving algebraic equations. Over time, AI experienced multiple waves of hype and setbacks, often referred to as \"AI winters.\" However, with the advent of deep learning, availability of large datasets, and high-performance computing, AI systems today power a wide range of applications, including recommendation engines, autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis tools, and large language models like ChatGPT.\n",
